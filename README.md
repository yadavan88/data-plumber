# data-plumber
Moving your data through pipes, with ease!


A sample implementation showcasing clean, type-safe data integration patterns in Scala. Data-Plumber demonstrates how to build intuitive interfaces for transferring data between different sources and sinks - whether it's CSV files, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or beyond.

## What's Inside?

- **Pattern Showcase**: Examples of clean source/sink implementations
- **Type-Safe Design**: Demonstrates leveraging Scala's type system
- **Simple Patterns**: Minimal, educational implementations
- **Extensible Examples**: Learn how to add your own sources and sinks
- **Reference Architecture**: Clean, consistent patterns you can adopt

This is an educational project showing how to:
- Build type-safe data transfer interfaces
- Implement clean CSV and MongoDB connectors
- Structure your own data pipeline code
- Avoid common integration pitfalls


It intentionally does not cover production concerns such as:
- Transaction management
- Retry mechanisms
- Error recovery
- Connection pooling
- Batch processing optimizations
